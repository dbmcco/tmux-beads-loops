# Project Status

## 2026-01-05

- Completed: Repurposed beads repo and added tmux/worktree workflow scripts, hooks, and docs; aligned Claude/Codex hooks and added OpenCode wrapper; renamed to tmux-beads-loops with global script symlinks.
- Tests: End-to-end tmux smoke test (global hooks, manager init, env export, notify ping, worktree create/clean).
- Blockers: None.
- Deliverables: `README.md`, `docs/TMUX_BEADS_LOOPS.md`, `scripts/tmux-beads-loops/*`, `.claude/settings.json` hook, `~/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`, `~/.local/bin/opencode`.
- Next steps: Add a tmux launcher if desired; commit and push to the new public repo.
